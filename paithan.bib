@book{GammaHelmEtAl95,
  abstract = {Capturing a wealth of experience about the design of object-oriented software, four top-notch designers present a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems. Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves. The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently. Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk.},

    abstract="We show that the classic placement games Col and Snort are PSPACE-complete, resolving an open question of Schaefer (1978). We then show the related placement games Fjords and NoGo PSPACE-complete on planar graphs. All but NoGo are shown hard by reductions from Bounded 2-Player Constraint Logic; we then reduce Col to NoGo. The only previous complexity results for these games were that Col and Snort played on general graphs are PSPACE-complete, and NoGo is NP-hard on general graphs.",
